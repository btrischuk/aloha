Aloha is a single page website created for a school project at RED Academy.  It was built as per the perameters specified for the project.

## The Process
This project has allowed me to develop my knowledge of mostly CSS and Javascript. I have become much more familiar with the tools required to accomplish these tasks and more efficient when it comes to refactoring.
